          <h2>What is Bitcoin Blockchain</h2>
          <p>
            The Bitcoin blockchain is a continuous
            a chain of blocks that is built with
            specific rules and contains information about
            transactions carried out on the network.
            Most often, copies of block chains that are not
            depend on each other are in parallel, and
            their processing is carried out from different PCs.

          <h3>How Review Observations Work in the Blockchain</h3>
          <p>1. Users initiate a bitcoin payment using special software, the so-called "wallets"</p>

        </section>
        <section>
          <p>2. All major transactions are sent to the global bitcoin network</p>

        </section>
        <section>
          <p>3. Approximately every 10 minutes, computers that are part of the global set (miners) combine several hundred transactions into a "block"</p>
          <p>4. Miners confirm a new transaction, thereby legitimizing it</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>5. For their work in the form of spent computing power, miners receive a reward in the form of emitted bitcoins.</p>

        </section>
        <section>
          <p>6. The next block is added to the general transaction database of the bitcoin network (blockchain)</p>
          <p>7. The receipt of new funds will be reflected in the recipient's wallet</p>

            stores the balance of each wallet,
            otherwise we would have to invent
            additional ways to protect</p>

        <section>
          <p>Any blockchain exists only while
            there are its miners who
            solve computational problems.
            These tasks should be enough
            simple so that network participants have
            stable probability of finding the answer -
            otherwise transactions will be confirmed
            eternity.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>Mining is when thousands of computers
            basements are buzzing all over the world,
            sorting through millions of numbers per second,
            trying to pick up a hash starting with
            10 zeros
            For finding the answer the computer (according to
            data for 2017) receives 12.5 BTC -
            is the amount of the reward
            generated

            bitcoin
            "from
            air" and decreases every four
            of the year.</p>

        <section>
          <p>Miners who mine virtual
            money, use processors for these purposes,
            video cards and other equipment. Last thing

            hash. After it is selected, it closes.
            block.
            The blockchain chain is distributed and
            supported by millions of computers
            the whole planet.</p>

          <h3>The reliability of the blockchain chain is provided by special algorithms:</h3>
          <p>proof of work</p>
          <p>proof-of-stake</p>
          <p style="font-size: 18px;">
            In the Bitcoin blockchain, the first option is used. Its principle of operation is similar to
            processes that take place in the office. If an employee of an organization
            completed the work, he will not be given wages. Algorithm
            PoW checks the calculations that are made when creating items
            chains. The system recognizes a block if its hash parameter is below the signature,
            which the miners were looking for. In other words, the correctness of the block
            calculated according to a special code, and the control of work is assigned to full
            nodes.

          <h3>Types of blockchain</h3>
          <p>Public - a chain of blocks,
            which
            available
            others
            users. This type of chain
            used in bitcoin
          </p>
          <p>Service - chain of blocks
              available to all users, but their
              quantity is limited.
          </p>
          <p>
            Private - a chain where access
            limited to reading and writing. Here
            priority setting available
            nodes. Such a blockchain involves
            limited group of people who
            are processing transactions.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Blockchain Pros</h3>
          <div style="font-size: 20px;">
            <p>Decentralization. Network members have equal rights and
              able to communicate directly with each other
              other, without the participation of intermediaries.
            </p>
            <p>
              Reliability. The likelihood of hacking by intruders or replacement
              information in the blocks is excluded, due to the use of
              encrypted keys.
            </p>
            <p>
              Transparency. The blocks of the blockchain chain are open to
              users, and transactions are easy to verify.
            </p>
            <p>
              Versatility. Blockchain is a unique technology that
              can be applied not only in the financial sector, but also in other
              areas.
            </p>
            <p>
              High speed. The possibilities of blockchain technology allow
              reduce transaction time to one minute.
            </p>
            <p>
              Low commissions. Due to the absence of commission payments,
              transaction fees are minimal.

        <section>
          <h3>Blockchain cons</h3>
          <div style="font-size: 20px;">
            <p>Irrevocability. Cancel the operation if it
              done by mistake, it won't work.
            </p>
            <p>
              Attack risk. If 51 percent of the Bitcoin chain is
              own one user, network integrity can be
              violated.
            </p>
            <p>
              Scalability. With the current block size
              the system processes up to seven operations in 1 second. FROM
              growth in the number of users of this indicator becomes
              few.
            </p>
            <p>
              status uncertainty. Many countries do not
              determined with the use of technology, and the question
              Cryptocurrency regulation is open until today
              day.

          <p>Blockchain technology can be used
            not only in the financial world, but also in a number of
            other areas of life:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              For protection of authorship and identification

            Internet.
            Possibilities of blockchain technology
            vast and can change forever
            the world for the better, affecting all areas
